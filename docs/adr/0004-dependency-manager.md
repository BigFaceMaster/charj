## Status

## Context

As a language, we need a dependency manager.

## Decision

In our case, we will had a very complex dependency manager and it's may be also a build system.

In first stage, we plan to use Maven's way to manage our dependency, then use Gradle way build a build system.

But it's still need more time to do it after we had done compiler.

## Consequences
